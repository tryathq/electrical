BACK DOWN CALCULATOR — How to run
=================================

1. Unzip this folder anywhere (e.g. Desktop or C:\BackDownCalculator).

2. Double-click:
   - If you have BackDownCalculator.exe: double-click BackDownCalculator.exe
   - Otherwise: START_APP.bat (Windows) or START_APP.sh (Mac/Linux)

3. Your browser will open with the app. Use it there.

4. To stop the app: close the black/terminal window that opened.
